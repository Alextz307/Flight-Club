# Flight-Deals

As a capstone project for a [course](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/), I created a **Python** terminal app for user database management and flight deal tracking. Integrated **API**s for real-time flight data retrieval and developed features for user registration and automated email/SMS notification of great flight deals.
